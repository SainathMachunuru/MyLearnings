OSI MODEL: open system inter-connection 

->Consist of  7 layers
->Each layer is package of protocals


APPLICATION LAYER:
-used by network applications i.e which use internet to communication with destinations servers(chrome,firefox,outllok,skype etc)
-all these networka applications uses applications layers protocals(http,ftp etc..)
-file transfer : FTP
-web surfing : HTTP/HTTPS
-emails : SMTP
-virtual terminals : telnet

PRESENTATION LAYER:
-it recieves data from APPLICATION LAYER
functions:
	Translation : convert data to binary form
	Data compression: reduce the number of bits od that transmisson speed will increase(eg:  video,audio files)
	Encryption/Decryption: using SSL(secure socket layer) protocal

SEESION LAYER:
functions:
	Connection/session management: 	eastablishing connection between commputers(may be server - client),
									send and recieves data(in the form of packets) and closing connection.
	Authentication: finding who the user is
	Autharisation: permission check

NOTE: web broweser perfrom functions of above 3 layers

TRANSPORT LAYER:
functions:
	segmentation : packet divids into segments.
				   each segment contains port number(to determine destination network app) and sequence number(for assemble purpose)
	flow control: using tranport layer ,can control data flow
				  eg:if server sending data at 50 mbps,and user's mobile can receice data with 10 mbps only
				  at that time using this layer data transmission from server reduce to 10 mbps.
	error control: using check sum to control the error data
protocals: 
	TCP(connection oriented):give feed back whether data is delivered or not
	UDP(connection-less):no feed back..thats y it is fast

NETWORK LAYER:
-tranport layer(segments) send data through network layer(packets)
functions:
	logical addressing: network layer adds sender and receivers ip to segment and forms IP-packet
	routing: moving IP-packets from source to destination,based on ipv4 and ipv6, mask routing decisions will be made.
	path determination: choosing best combination path from source to destination.protocals(OSPF,BGP,IS-IS)
	
DATA LINK LAYER:
-it recieves data-packet from network layer.
functions:
	physical addressing: datalink layer adds sender and receivers mac address to packet and forms frame
	access the media: allow upper layers to access the media by technique framing
	-control how data is placed and received  from the media by techniqs media-access-control and error ditection
	
PHYSICAL LAYER: 
-transforms frames binary data to singals
-electric signal in case of lan cable
-light in case of optical fiber cable
-radio signals in case of air
at recivers physical layer ,converts these signals into bits(binaray from) pass to datalink layer as frame.

This data moves to highers layers(frame->packet->segment) finally it will reach application layer and uses some
protocalls to display data in users computer.
