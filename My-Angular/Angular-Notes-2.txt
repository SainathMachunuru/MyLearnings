@@@@ SERVICES AND DEPENDENCY INJECTION	@@@
-used for code reusability
-we can inject service to components and other services also
-hierarchical injector:
	based on the service providing place, it's use may change:
		-AppModule:Same instance of service is available for application-wide
		-AppComponentent: same instance of service is available for all components[but not for other services]
		-Any Other Component: same instance of service is available for the component and all its child components
@Injectable(): used for call one service from other service(which has injectable decorator)
- '...' used to add array elememts indivually to a list at a time

@@@@ ROUTING @@@
-for single page application loading
-absolute path add given path to app directory(eg:/users)
-relative path add given path to current component directory(eg:users or ./users or ../users)
-routerLink and navigate method both useful for navigation
	-routerLink know on which component currently we are(it will behave differently for absolute and relative paths)
	-navigate method does not know current component(it will work fine for absolute and relative paths)
	-navigate method defaulty relative to root component(AppComponentent)
-ActivatedRoute indicates currenly active route
- route.snapshot.params initailze route param values on ngOnInit()
-route.params.subscribe() update the route param values when changes happens
