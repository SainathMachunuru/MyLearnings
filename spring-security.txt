-Autharization: verifying user's actions
-Principal : its hold currently loggged user and it returns by spring security once authentication done
-Granted Authority : list of authorities/permisions user have

-default behavior of spring security config:
	-creates user(defulat user name is ''user and pwd will be generated one) if there is no user config 
	-creates default login form
	-error handling for form authentication
	-all APIs need authentication
	
	
Authentication:
	-we need to configure authentication manager using authentication builder
	-our configuration class should extends WebSecurityConfigAdapter so that we can override configure method  method and can pass authentication builder as an argument.
	 -using configure method spring security authenticate rquest using in-memory/db/ldap
	 - will use PasswordEncoder Bean to encode users password
	 
	 
Autharization: 
	-we need to configure HttpSecurity for autAutharization
	-our configuration class should extends WebSecurityConfigAdapter so that we can override configure  method and can pass HttpSecurity  as an argument.
	-we can authorize incoming requests  based on url patterns and user roles
	-the order of authoriasation should form most restictive to least restrictive(eg: admin,user,permitAll etc..)
