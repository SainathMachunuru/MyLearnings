-HTML is content and JS is behavior
-execution of js in browser or node(has js engine)

variable types:
	primitive/Value types:
		String
		Number
		Boolean
		undefined -->undefined is type and also a value
		null ---typee of null is object
		
		-dynamic type language(variable types may change)
		-default values of variables in js is undefined
		
	Reference types
		Objects
		Arrays
			-arrays in js are dynamic
			-we can stores different types of objects/variables in array.
			-type of array is object
		Functions
			-function is a object
		
	-primitives are copied by values
	-objects are copied by references(memory address)

OOPS IN JS:
	object: 
		-collection of key-value pairs
		-has properties(primitive/object/method)
		-object creation:
			creating an object using object literal way
			creating an object using factory method
			creating an object using constructor method
		-Object() is built in constructor in js
		-every object has 'constructor' property that used to create that object(actually crated by built-in function called Function())
		-every functions is an object(function has methods like call() and apply())
		-objects in js are dynamic(add/remove properties)
		-if a function is inside object then it is method of that object
scopes:
	-local variables take presedance over global variables in blocks or functions(if they declare with same name)
	-local variables will have scope within block of code
	-global variables will have scope throught js file
	
let VS var:
	-var:function-scoped
	-let,const:block-scoped(ES6(ES2015))
	-if we decalre global variable woth 'var' keyword,it will attached to window object(it may lead to issues)
	
this keyword:
	-The object that is executing the current function
